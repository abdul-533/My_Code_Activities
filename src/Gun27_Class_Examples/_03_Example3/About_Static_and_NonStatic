Difference and purpose of use of Static and non-Static methods
-STATIC methods
 1) The word static is prefixed with it.
 2) GENERAL, i.e. covering all objects, i.e. object
   It is created to use standalone methods without creating objects.
 3) Since these methods are not Object-specific, they are TYPE methods.
   They can be used directly with the TYPE name.
 4) Appropriate example static methods available in Java such as Math.random
   or functions like Integer.parseInt().

-non-STATIC methods
 1) These methods are object-specific methods.
 2) Since it has to work with the values of the object-specific object
   Be sure to create an object with new. They are used with object variable.


That is, the methods that will work by needing object properties are normal methods.
      Since it is of general interest to the methods that will work without the need for object properties
            Since it should belong to the TYPE, static is prefixed with the name of the TYPE directly.
            they are used.
